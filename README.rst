**Authomatic**
is a **framework agnostic** library
for **Python** web applications
with a **minimalistic** but **powerful** interface
which simplifies **authentication** of users
by third party providers like **Facebook** or **Twitter**
through standards like **OAuth** and **OpenID**.

For more info visit the project page at http://authomatic.github.io/authomatic.

Maintainers
===========

**Authomatic** was migrated from a private project of Peter Hudec to a community-managed project.
Many thanks to Peter Hudec for all his hard work for creating and maintaining **authomatic**!
We are now a small team of volunteers, not paid for the work here.
Any help is appreciated!

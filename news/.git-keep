News Fragments

The news files are one per issue, best using the issue-number or pull-request (PR) number as filename prefix.

towncrier has a few standard types of news fragments, signified by the file extension. These are:

    .breaking: Signifying a deprecation or removal of public API.
    .feature: Signifying a new feature.
    .bugfix: Signifying a bug fix.
    .doc: Signifying a documentation improvement.
    .misc: A ticket has been closed, but it is not of interest to users.

Example:

    - ``1234.bugfix``
    - for two separate fixes in one PR `3423-1.bugfix`` and ``3423-2.bugfix``

Sphinx Syntax is allowed.
